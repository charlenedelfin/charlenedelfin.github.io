  		      <p>Hello, world! My name is Charlene Delfin and I am â€¦ um, too many things to too many people. Fortunately for all of us, this website focuses only on the top things I actually do. This website will help you find all my fiction stories, poetry, programs, and Zazzle store. It saves us time.</p>
  			    <p>This website is being developed by me. Yaaasss! I finally learned enough to build my own website! *makes mini jump of joy*</p>
  			  <p>Mind you, I am not yet a programmer. I am still learning. Basically, I am just another person on the internet. Call me Charlene.</p>

    	    <h2>Stories</h2>
          <p><a href="http://bit.ly/3YKwyzk" target="_blank">"An Unknown Narrator"</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/TheKingsChiefStores" target="_blank">"The King's Chief"</a> are my current ebooks. The first one is a crime fiction about an unknown narrator who is spying on a group of young, wealthy Theater Arts students. You can find its print copy on <a href="http://bit.ly/3Lik2US" target="_blank">LuLu</a>. The second one is a thriller about a group of tourists who climbed one of the tallest trees in the world, and fell off. There are also <a href="http://bit.ly/3yyZMGI" target="_blank">WIPs</a> in my collection. There are also over a thousand poems in different genres spread across many sites.</p>
    		  <p>All of these will be moved to WattPad soon, but for now, you can check out what is already on WattPad.</p>

    	  <h2>Programs</h2>
      	<p>The Farm is actually my second Scratch program. It is a farm game. My first Scratch program is Car Race. It is a racing game. They were CS50x submissions.</p>
    		<p>Writing App is a little program that has been in development since 2022. It is supposed to separate groups of text in a given document, but it is still buggy. It is open source, so feel free to use my code in your own programs or change it.</p>
      	<p>This website is also still in development. You will see it keep changing. It is supposed to represent my progress in learning programming.</p>

    	  <h2>Store</h2>
    		<p>There was a time when being a "Zazzler" was a thing in my world, and I created my store only to be part of that crowd. In the beginning, the name of my store was my old Zazzle username, charlenedelfindesigns. (Pun intended. The mischievous person in me thought it would be hilarious to suggest that Charlene Delfin, whom most people described as sweet, actually had "designs".)</p>
    		<p>It became The Gift of Colors in 2020 because it was a gift shop that had colorful items. These days, the only purpose of the store is to showcase my work with vector designs.</p>
