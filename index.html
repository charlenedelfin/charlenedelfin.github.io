  	<p>
Hello, world! My name is Charlene Delfin and I am ... well, it is best to not associate myself with a single idea. This website is being developed by yours truly, but I am not a programmer. I am only studying programming. Yes, I have studied enough to code my own website! Yay! *makes mini jump of excitement*
  	</p>
  	<p>
    This website also contains details about my activities in the past like self-publishing and creating vector designs. It also has my official pages, and details about my recent whereabouts in internet land.
  	</p>
  	<p>
    I am simply an ordinary person with an internet connection. Call me Charlene.
  	</p>
    <h3>Here are the things I have done in the past:</h3>
    <h2 id="books">Books</h2>
    <p>Writing has been my primary work. I have been self-publishing since November 2011, but my most recent book was in March 2019. Also, even though I have lots of WIPs, I am currently not working on any book.</p>
    <p>I am planning to move all my books and poems to WattPad. It will take a lot of work and courage. Work, because I have written plenty of books and way too many poems. Courage, because I have an undying fear that my writing is bad and people will find out bad things about me in my works. Wish I could hide them.</p>
    <h3>You can find my fiction and poetry on WattPad.</h3>
    <h2>Programs</h2>
    <p>Again, I am not a programmer. When I was a beginner, I thought that you could call yourself a programmer if you can write a program. As I delved deeper into the world of programming, I realized that it is a strict place with individuals who hold positions that are in certain hierarchies. Their positions depend solely on what kind of programs they can build. I am technically a student. I need to do more study and programming to reach even the level of "junior programmer". It is mind-breakingly hard, but when I get "in the zone", it is fun.</p>
    <h3>You can access the source code of this website on GitHub.<h3>
    <h2>Vector Designs</h2>
    <p>Drawing portraits was my hobby growing up. When I went online, I transferred my drawing skills to creating vector designs through Inkscape.</p>
    <p>Back in those years, being a "Zazzler" was a thing. I created my own Zazzle store just to join the crowd. The bad thing about my Zazzle store is that its products are too expensive. Nobody buys my Zazzle items. My store only serves as a showcase for my designs.</p>
    <p>I do not pursue design because I cannot do it quickly. It takes me a whole week just to finish one design. I can write a poem in five minutes.</p>
    <h3>You can find samples of my vector designs on Zazzle.</h3>
    <h2>Chess</h2>
    <p>Games have been a part of my life since I became familiar with computers. I played a lot of games, but they were all random and I do not even remember my usernames and passwords anymore. They were little, free online games. They were usually in the simulation, arcade, and multiplayer categories. I played them only to free my frustrations at the time. The one game that I keep coming back to is chess.</p>
    <p>I do not play chess professionally, it is just a little bit of a hobby. I did not even study chess, I was only taught the basics.</p>
      <h3>You can play chess with me on Chess.com.</h3>
      <h3>Where to find me:</h3>
      <p>Recently, I have been spending a lot of time volunteering on 7 Cups, but I do not take 1-on-1 chats anymore and I rarely visit the group chats. I just work as a mentor in the Internship Program of the 7 Cups Academy. I spend some time in the forum.</p>
      <p>You can also see me writing on OhWrite every once in a while, but I do not use the chatroom.</p>
      <p>I have also been trying to finish the courses on freeCodeCamp, but I rarely hang out in the forums.</p>
      <p>You can message me on Facebook, but I do not check my messages frequently.</p>
